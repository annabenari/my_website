  about: `<h2>About</h2> <img class="me" src="/me.png" alt=" A portrait of me, brown hair, blue top"> <p> An artist and curator deeply passionate about the intricate expressions of human faces—sometimes distorted—and the beauty of the natural world. My creative journey is inspired by the interplay between women, femininity, and nature, recognising their profound interconnectedness. I believe that the woman’s form is an integral part of nature, allowing me to craft pieces that embody a holistic narrative, weaving together these three elements into a cohesive whole. </p> <p>I am dedicated to continuous learning and creative exploration, always seeking new ways to expand my artistic repertoire. Through my work, I strive to share my vision and connect with a wider audience, hosting exhibitions that showcase my creations and reflect my evolving perspective. Recent curatorial experiences at Babylon Arts and the Norwich & Norfolk Festival have enriched my understanding of cultural programming. I co-curated multiple exhibitions, handling everything from artist selection to installation, ensuring that every aspect met high standards. </p> <p> My current role as a Duty Manager and Marketing assistant at Babylon Arts further immerses me in the art community, where I support operational needs and engage with the public. My educational background includes a Gold Arts Award from Trinity College London, along with several certificates in graphic design, marketing, and web development. These qualifications complement my practical experience and have equipped me with strong organizational skills. Whether planning workshops or coordinating events, I thrive on turning creative visions into reality. I am particularly passionate about fostering diversity and inclusion in the arts.</p> <p> I’ve collaborated with organisations like the RNIB on the Sensing Nature exhibition to create accessible experiences for visually impaired visitors. Additionally, I’ve led workshops for individuals who have been excluded from mainstream education, emphasizing the importance of creativity as a means of empowerment and expression. </p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new artistic mediums and engaging with local communities through workshops and projects. My love for art drives me to participate in initiatives that address societal challenges, and I am excited to contribute to innovative programs that make a difference. Over the years, I have had the privilege of conducting workshops with esteemed institutions such as the <a class="links" href="https://www.wysingartscentre.org/" target="_blank">Wysing Art Centre</a>, the <a class="links" href="https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Fitzwilliam Museum</a>, <a class="links" href="https://www.elymuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ely Museum</a>, Ely Market, and Fermynwoods. These collaborations have enriched my practice and deepened my commitment to inclusivity and community engagement.</p> <p>   Thank you for visiting my website! I invite you to explore my work and connect with me as I continue my artistic journey, merging my passion for art with meaningful community involvement.</p>`,

    "<h2>Creative Facilitation</h2><h4>Print Making Workshop, Wysing Art Centre - November 2024<h4/><p>This session was an engaging, hands-on workshop focused on creative printmaking with natural elements. Participants explored basic printmaking techniques, using found objects from nature and everyday items. The goal is to encourage creativity and experimentation in a supportive and inspiring environment.</p><br><h4>'Play, Build Play', Fitzwilliam Museaum - August 2024</h4><p>As the facilitator of the Summer Play Pavilion, my role was to actively engage with families visiting the event and foster an inviting and playful environment. I guided participants in exploring the curated collection of loose parts, encouraging creative play, collaboration, and the development of their own sporting and cultural activities. This involved demonstrating ways to use the materials, suggesting imaginative ideas, and supporting both children and adults in their play, ensuring everyone felt welcomed and inspired.</p><br><h4>Ferynwoods</h4><p>Info</p><br><h4>Fitzwilliam Museaum - Febuary 2023</h4><p>For SOURCE, I conducted an  interactive workshop designed to inspire and support GCSE, A-Level, BTEC, and Foundation Art & Design students, I introduced students to Tagtool, an innovative digital tool that enables live, collaborative digital art creation by projecting drawings and animations in real-time. I began by demonstrating how to use Tagtool's features, such as layering, animation, and interactive drawing techniques. Following the demonstration, students and I worked together to create a collaborative piece, encouraging them to experiment with their own ideas and contribute to the collective artwork. This hands-on session allowed students to engage with new media, think creatively, and understand the potential of integrating technology with traditional art practices.</p><br> <h4>Ely Museum</h4><p>Info</p><br><h4>Fitzwilliam Museaum - Febuary 2022</h4><p>For SOURCE, I  offered a flexible, drop-in visual art curatorial session, where students could explore and discuss various artistic approaches and inspirations with my guidance. This informal setup created an environment where students could connect their exam themes to broader artistic concepts and techniques. Additionally, I led a scheduled tote bag printing session, where participants could design and print their own art onto tote bags. This activity involved teaching basic printmaking techniques, encouraging students to apply their unique styles and experiment with composition and color.</p><br>  <h4>Ely Market</h4><p>Info</p>",
