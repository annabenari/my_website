    <h1>Sensing Nature Exhibition</h1>
    <p>
      Over the past 18 months, I had the privilege of co-curating the <strong>Sensing Nature</strong> exhibition, 
      which formed part of the wider <strong>Inspired by Nature</strong> project. This program, spearheaded by Babylon ARTS 
      and supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, aimed to connect people to nature through creative approaches 
      and improve accessibility to arts and heritage.

      As part of this initiative, I worked alongside the Basecoat Collective, a team of young curators, to bring the 
      <strong>Sensing Nature</strong> exhibition to life. This project celebrated the stories and heritage of the Fenland 
      landscape while fostering a sense of inclusivity and engagement for all participants and visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I collaborated with other members of the Basecoat Collective to curate the <strong>Sensing Nature</strong> exhibition. 
      Together, we reviewed submissions from the open call, which invited the public to share their creative responses to 
      time spent in nature. These submissions, ranging from drawings to sculptures and sound pieces, were carefully selected 
      and arranged to create an engaging and cohesive narrative that explored personal connections with nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I contributed to the visual and spatial layout of the exhibition, ensuring that the artworks were presented in a way 
      that encouraged exploration and reflection. This involved thoughtful arrangement of pieces to create a harmonious 
      balance between the different media, while also considering accessibility and audience engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a co-curator, I supported the exhibition team by helping to manage communications with artists and collaborators. 
      I also took part in discussions around how to ensure the exhibition was as welcoming and inclusive as possible, 
      assisting with practical solutions to enhance the visitor experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my curatorial role, I contributed to the promotion of the exhibition through social media campaigns 
      and outreach efforts. This helped to attract a wide audience and ensured the exhibition was well-received by the 
      local community and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Sensing Nature</strong> exhibition was an incredibly rewarding project to be part of. It demonstrated 
      the importance of collaboration in curatorial work, and I gained valuable experience in managing an exhibition from 
      concept to completion. Iâ€™m particularly proud of how the project invited public participation and showcased the 
      creativity of individuals from diverse backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this experience, I developed skills in curation, communication, and exhibition design, which I look forward 
      to applying to future projects. The opportunity to work on a project with such a strong community focus and 
      connection to nature has been both inspiring and transformative.
