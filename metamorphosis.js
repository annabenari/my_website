  <h3>Metamorphosis Exhibition</h3>
  <p> Artist statment : I am an artist and curator passionate about human expressions—sometimes distorted—and the beauty of nature. My work explores the connection between women, femininity, and nature, viewing the woman’s form as integral to the natural world. This inspires holistic pieces that weave these themes into a cohesive narrative. Dedicated to learning and creative growth, I seek new ways to expand my artistic repertoire. I strive to connect with audiences through exhibitions reflecting my evolving perspective. My curatorial experience includes Babylon Arts and Norwich & Norfolk Festival, co-curating exhibitions, selecting artists, overseeing installations, and ensuring high standards throughout.</p>
