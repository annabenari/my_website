  <h4>Fitzwilliam Museum - February 2024 </h4>
  <p>
    For SOURCE, I conducted an interactive workshop for GCSE, A-Level, BTEC, and Foundation Art & Design students, introducing them to Tagtool, a digital tool for live, collaborative digital art creation. I demonstrated its features and guided students in a collaborative project, encouraging them to experiment with their own ideas and contribute to the collective artwork.

    <h4>Ely Market - August 2023</h4>
    <p>The workshops, titled Picture Me, Ely, focused on self-portraits as a means of creative self-expression. Held on the 12th and 19th, each session was led by volunteers specializing in different artistic techniques such as collage, painting, and printing. Participants were guided to create unique self-portraits within these mediums, celebrating their individuality and connection to Ely. Preparations included volunteers developing mock-ups of their chosen styles, with collaborative planning meetings ensuring a cohesive and engaging experience for everyone involved.

    <h4>Fermynwoods - February 2023 </h4>
    <p>
    In the workshop, I guided students through techniques for creating pattern and print, starting with Styrofoam as a base for experimenting with repetition, color, and form. We worked across various fabrics, exploring how each one’s unique texture affected the outcome of the stamps and designs.
    One of the most memorable parts of the day was spent outdoors, gathering leaves, bark, and other natural materials from the woods. We played with inking and printing directly from these found objects onto different fabrics, letting nature influence our designs in unexpected ways. At the end of the session, each student brought their designs together, creating unique prints on tote bags to take home—capturing the spirit of the day in a tangible way.

      In this SOURCE session, I led a flexible, drop-in visual art curatorial workshop for students to explore and discuss various artistic approaches and inspirations. I also conducted a tote bag printing session, teaching basic printmaking techniques and encouraging students to experiment with composition and color.
