  <p>‘THE HOUSE’ will be on display to the public for a very limited run of two days, for 30th and 31st December 2023, 12-4pm, at Babylon Gallery. </p>
  <p>THE HOUSE’ is an ambitious sculptural piece inspired by the vivid imagery and literary elements of the novel ‘Piranesi’ by Susanna Clarke.<br>
  The installation will be constructed entirely from ‘waste’ materials, donated by local businesses and people during this season of excess. Basecoat hopes that the piece will be act as a reflection upon times gone by, asking thought-provoking questions, as well as a hopeful gaze toward the future. Taking place over the new year, it feels like a fitting time for such a conversation.</p>
