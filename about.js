        I am an artist and curator deeply passionate about the intricate expressions of human faces—sometimes distorted—and the beauty of the natural world. My creative journey is inspired by the interplay between women, femininity, and nature, recognizing their profound interconnectedness. I believe that the woman’s form is an integral part of nature, allowing me to craft pieces that embody a holistic narrative, weaving these three elements into a cohesive whole.

        Dedicated to continuous learning and creative exploration, I am always seeking new ways to expand my artistic repertoire. Through my work, I strive to connect with a wider audience, hosting exhibitions that reflect my evolving perspective. Recent curatorial experiences at Babylon Arts and the Norwich & Norfolk Festival have enriched my understanding of cultural programming. I co-curated multiple exhibitions, managing artist selection, installation, and ensuring high standards throughout.

        My role as a Duty Manager and Marketing Assistant at Babylon Arts immerses me in the art community, where I support operations and engage with the public. I hold a Gold Arts Award from Trinity College London and certificates in graphic design, marketing, and web development. These complement my practical experience, equipping me with strong organizational skills. Whether planning workshops or coordinating events, I thrive on bringing creative visions to life, with a focus on fostering diversity and inclusion in the arts.

        I’ve collaborated with organizations like the RNIB on the Sensing Nature exhibition to create accessible experiences for visually impaired visitors. I have also led workshops for individuals excluded from mainstream education, emphasizing creativity as a means of empowerment and expression.

        In my free time, I explore new artistic mediums and engage with local communities through workshops and projects. My love for art drives me to participate in initiatives that address societal challenges. I have conducted workshops with institutions such as the <a class="links" href="https://www.wysingartscentre.org/" target="_blank">Wysing Art Centre</a>, the <a class="links" href="https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Fitzwilliam Museum</a>, <a class="links" href="https://www.elymuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">Ely Museum</a>, Ely Market, and Fermynwoods, enriching my practice and deepening my commitment to inclusivity and community engagement.
